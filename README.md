I bulit a file-based key-value data store that supports the basic CRD(create,read and delete) operations.This data store is meant to be used as a local storage using one single process on one laptop.The data store must be exposed as a library to clients that can instantiate a class and work with the data store.
the data also support functional requirements and non-functional requirements.
